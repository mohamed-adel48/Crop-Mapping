# Crop-Mapping (Graduation Project)

#Dataset Description
This dataset focuses on the classification of agricultural and non-agricultural land cover types in the Al-Faiyum region of Egypt using Sentinel-2A satellite imagery. The imagery, captured from January to March 2016, covers 10 spectral bands and spans geographical coordinates from approximately 29.00째 to 29.40째 North latitude and 30.50째 to 31.00째 East longitude. The classification scheme categorizes the region into seven classes: clover, wheat, trees, background, water, urban, and land. This data helps in understanding the spatial distribution of various elements, aiding resource management and agricultural planning. Ground truth datasets were used to create testing and training datasets for model development.

We are grateful to the National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences (NARSS) for providing us with the dataset.
