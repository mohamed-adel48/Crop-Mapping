# Crop-Mapping (Graduation Project)
## Overview
This project focuses on the classification of land cover and agricultural crops in the Al-Faiyum region of Egypt using Sentinel-2A satellite imagery and deep learning techniques. By leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, we achieved an impressive 95% accuracy across seven classes, including clover, wheat, and urban areas. This work provides valuable insights for resource management and agricultural planning.

In addition, we developed a user-friendly website to visualize and interact with our classification results. Built using React and Tailwind CSS, the website enhances accessibility for stakeholders and decision-makers, allowing them to explore the classified land cover data seamlessly.

## Dataset Description
This dataset focuses on the classification of agricultural and non-agricultural land cover types in the Al-Faiyum region of Egypt using Sentinel-2A satellite imagery. The imagery, captured from January to March 2016, covers 10 spectral bands and spans geographical coordinates from approximately 29.00째 to 29.40째 North latitude and 30.50째 to 31.00째 East longitude. The classification scheme categorizes the region into seven classes: clover, wheat, trees, background, water, urban, and land. This data helps in understanding the spatial distribution of various elements, aiding resource management and agricultural planning. Ground truth datasets were used to create testing and training datasets for model development.

We are grateful to the **National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences** [NARSS](https://github.com/NARSS) for providing us with the dataset.
## Website
  ### Front-End

  ### Back-End
  Responsible for communication between the model and the client-side server, the backend consists of two web application frameworks: **Node.js** and **Django**. Node.js is used for query and creating dashboard collections, while Django handles image preprocessing, loading the model, and crop classification.
